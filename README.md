# ProDOS-Utilities
This project is just starting but is intended to be both a command line tool and library to provide access to ProDOS based hard drive images. It is written in Go to be cross platform (Linux, Windows, macOS etc.). Functionality, naming and parameters are subject to change without notice. This project was started so I would be able to automate writing the firmware file into the drive image for one of my other projects [Apple2-IO-RPi](https://github.com/tjboldt/Apple2-IO-RPi).

## DISCLAIMER
Being a work in progress, be warned that this code is likely to corrupt drive images so be sure to have backups. Also, command line parameters are likely to change significantly in the future.
